# Chapter 1: Logic and Proofs 

## Argument

An **argument** is a set of statements, one of which is called the
**conclusion** and the rest of which are called **premises**. An argument is
said to be **valid** if the conclusion must be true (*deducible* from the
premises using the rules of logic) whenever the premises are all true. If
it is possible for all the premises to *hold* (be true) and the conclusion not
*follow* (be deducible from the premises), the argument is **invalid**.
