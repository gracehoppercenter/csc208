# Section 1.2: Implications 


## Implication

An **implication** (or **conditional**) is a molecular statement of the form
$$ 
P \rightarrow Q
$$ 
where $P$ and $Q$ are the statements. We say that

* $P$ is the **hypothesis** (or **antecedent**).
* $Q$ is the **conclusion** (or **consequent**).

An implication is *true* provided $P$ is false or $Q$ is true (or both),
and *false* otherwise. In particular, the only way for $P \rightarrow Q$ to be
false is for $P$ to be true *and* $Q$ to be false.


## Converse, Contrapositive, and Inverse

Given an implicatin $P \rightarrow Q$, we say,

* The **converse** is the implication $Q \rightarrow P$.
* The **contrapositve** is the implication $\lnot Q \rightarrow \lnot P$.
* The **inverse** is the implication $\lnot P \rightarrow \lnot Q$.


## Necessary and Sufficient

* "$P$ is necessary for $Q$" means $Q \rightarrow P$. 
* "$P$ is sufficient for $Q$" means $P \rightarrow Q$. 
* If $P$ is necessary and sufficient for $Q$, then $P \leftrightarrow Q$.
