# Chapter 1.5: Proofs about Discrete Structures

## Subsets, Supersets, and Proper Subsets

A set $A$ is a **subset** of a set $B$, written $A \subseteq B$, provided
every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$.

The set $B$ is sometimes called a **superset** of $A$.

We say $A$ is a **proper subset** of $B$, written $A \subset B$ and $A \neq B$.
In other words, if every element in $A$ is an element $B$, and there is at
least on element in $B$ that is *not* in $A$.
