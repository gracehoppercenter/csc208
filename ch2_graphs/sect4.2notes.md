# Chapter 4.2: Trees 

A **tree** is a connected graph containing no cycles (i.e. it is *acyclic*).

A **forest** is a graph containing no cycles. (which means that a connected
forest is a tree).


## Tree Properties

**Proposition 4.2.1.** A graph $T$ is a tree if and only if between every pair
of distinct vertices of $T$ there is a unique path.

**Corollary 4.2.2.** A graph $F$ is a forest if and only if between any pair of
verticies in $F$ there is at most one path.

**Proposition 4.2.3.** Any tree with at least two vertices has at least two
vertices of degree one.
